# Demo Projects Repository

Welcome to my portfolio repository! This space is designed to showcase my work in building high-performance, scalable software solutions. Below, you'll find two significant projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in backend development, real-time communication, task tracking, and more.

## Projects

### 2. [Middleware for Software-Defined Storage](./project2(23-now))

This is a **middleware solution for software-defined storage**, built with:

- **FastAPI** for the API layer.
- **CockroachDB** for the distributed database system.
- **etcd** for configuration management.
- An optional **LDAP** authentication flow along with token-based authentication. You can find examples of the authentication logic in the `auth` folder, which contains endpoints and token handling.
